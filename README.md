Microsoft Office is a productivity software suite, now part of the broader cloud-based service Microsoft 365, that includes applications for tasks like word processing (Word), data analysis (Excel), presentations (PowerPoint), and email (Outlook). Users can access these applications through subscription plans in Microsoft 365, which also provides cloud storage and other collaborative services, or via a one-time purchase of perpetual licenses for the Office!
